# CartService
Spring+mongoDB REST app
Technical requirements:

Web application should contain 3 layers
Controller
Service
Repository
REST Api should be exposed for the next operations
Create a new cart
Get a cart by id
Delete cart by id
Get all carts in the system
Get all carts in the system with details(optional, require additional fields, see the section below)
Create item
Delete item
Get all items
Add item to the cart by cart id
Get all items from cart by cart id
Delete item from cart by item id
The Cart and Item objects should be persisted in memory(Java Array List will be fine for this stage).
Application should be covered by Unit tests on each layer independently, each layer should be completely mocked
